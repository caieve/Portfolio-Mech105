This MATLAB code implements the False Position Method for finding the root of a given function. This code iterates to find the root of a function by bracketing between two initial guesses and then narrowing the search interval based on the signs of the function values at the two endpoints of the interval. The inputs of this function are func (the given function), xl (the lower bound), xu (the upper bound), maxit (the maximum number of iterations defaulted to 200 ), es (the relative error of 0.0001%), varargin (additional parameters). The outputs of this function are root (the estimated root), fx (the function evaluated at the root), ea (the approximate relative error), and iter (the number of iterations performed). In order to use this function, the user only needs to input the desired function, as well as outer and lower bounds that are certain to be outside the root. The function will then iterate between bounds until it either reaches 200 iterations or a root is found to relative error of 0.0001%.
